Chaos Genius is an open-source business observability platform. Chaos Genius enables businesses to monitor thousands of KPIs, across multiple data sources, and perform automated root cause analysis for any deviation in the KPIs. 

Chaos Genius can help teams reduce their Mean-Time-To-Detect (MTTD) and Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) for any issues in their business and system KPIs. 

Standard BI dashboards enable data visualization to track how select metrics are trending. However, diagnosing why a particular metric or KPI has changed, remains a woefully manual process involving slicing & dicing the data, coordination with multiple teams in an organization to identify related events and monitoring externalities. 

With Chaos Genius, we aim to automate the diagnosis and root-cause-analysis for deviations in different business and system KPIs at scale.
