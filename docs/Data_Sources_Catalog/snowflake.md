# Snowflake

Chaos Genius uses Airbyte's [Snowflake connector](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations/sources/snowflake).

To connect Snowflake as a data source, you will need the following information:

-   Account Name

-   Role

-   Warehouse

-   Database

-   Schema

-   Username

-   Password

It is recommended to create a dedicated read-only user with access to the relevant schemas.
