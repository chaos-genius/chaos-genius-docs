# GCP Deployment

## Step 1: Setting up your account

Create or log into your GCP account & select appropriate project.

## Step 2: Deploying the instance

1. Enable the Compute Engine API and create a new VM instance.

2. Name your VM chaosgenius
3. Select your desired region and zone.
4. For KPIs that process up to 10M rows, select e2-standard-4 machine type under the E2 series of the general-purpose machine family. (This will provision 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM)

5. Change the boot disk from the default Debian Linux to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Increase the boot disk size to 30GB. (30GB is recommended)

6. Click on Networking, and under network tags, type in chaosgenius as a tag.

7. Leave the other options as default and create the instance.
8. Wait for the instance to be provisioned.

## Step 3: Configure GCP Networking and Firewall

1. From the GCP console sidebar, Choose Networking > VPC network > Firewall.  
   ![Set Firewall](/img/Setup/GCP/vm-firewall.png)
2. Choose "Create Firewall Rule"
3. Name the rule as chaosgenius
4. To apply the rule to select VM instances, select Targets > "Specified target tags", and enter chaosgenius into Target tags
5. Set Source IPv4 ranges to allow traffic from all IPs: 0.0.0.0/0
6. To allow incoming TCP connections to port 8080, in Specified Protocols and Ports, check tcp and enter 8080  
   ![Set TCP connections](/img/Setup/GCP/vm-tcp.png)
7. Click Create

## Step 4: Installing Dependencies

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on your machine.
2. Verify your installation of docker with `sudo systemctl status docker`.
    Your output should be similar to this:
    ![Docker verification output](/img/Setup/docker-output.png)
3. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine.
4. Verify your installation of docker-compose with `docker-compose --version`.
    Your output should be similar to this:
    ![Docker verification output](/img/Setup/docker-compose-output.png)

## Step 5: Cloning the repository

1. Clone the repository  
    ```git clone https://github.com/chaos-genius/chaos_genius```
2. Move into the repository:  
    ```cd chaos_genius```

## Step 6: Start the containers

1. Bring containers to life with:  
    ```sudo docker-compose up```  

    Or you can use the detached mode, which is preferable on servers as it allows the containers to run in the background.  
    ```sudo docker-compose up -d```

    If you also need any third-party data sources such as Google Sheets, Google Analytics, Shopify, Stripe, Bind Ads, Facebook Marketing or Google Ads, use the `docker-compose.thirdparty.yml` file:  
    ```sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.thirdparty.yml up -d```

2. To view real time logs run:  
    ```sudo docker-compose logs -f```

## Step 7: Access the Dashboard

Once you see the Chaos Genius success banner, the UI is ready to be accessed at `<Public IP>:8080`.  
If everything was successful, you should see this page at the URL:

Note: Check your dashboard for your machineâ€™s public IP.
