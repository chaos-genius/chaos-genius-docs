## Step 4: Cloning the repository

1. Clone the repository  
    ```git clone https://github.com/chaos-genius/chaos_genius```
2. Move into the repository:  
    ```cd chaos_genius```

## Step 5: Start the containers

1. Bring containers to life with:  
    ```sudo docker-compose up```  

    Or you can use the detached mode, which is preferable on servers as it allows the containers to run in the background.  
    ```sudo docker-compose up -d```
2. To view real time logs run:  
    ```sudo docker-compose logs -f```

## Step 6: Access the Dashboard

Once you see the Chaos Genius success banner, the UI is ready to be accessed at `<Public IP>:8080`.  
If everything was successful, you should see this page at the URL:
