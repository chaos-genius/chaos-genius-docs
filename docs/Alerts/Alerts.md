# Alerts

Alerts are a great way to keep track of any serious anomalies  in your KPI, and ChaosGenius makes setting them up a breeze!

## Add Alert Destination


To add alerts, first you'll need to configure the channel through which you'll get the alerts. Currently we offer Slack and Email but channels such as Datadog, Asana, Teams are coming soon.

### Slack Configuration


### Email Configuration

To recieve alerts via email you'll need to set up an email account via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
