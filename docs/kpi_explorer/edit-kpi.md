The `Select Data Source` field can only be viewed but not edited. Rest other fields can be updated in a regular manner. 

:::note
Editing any field excluding `KPI Name` and `Dashboard` will result in all previous data of the KPI being deleted and the analytics being run again.

Once all fields have been updated press the `Save Changes` button on the bottom right to update the KPI configuration.
